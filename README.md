Project Description:
This project is an online shopping website where customers can register, browse products, and place orders. The website provides a platform for customers to purchase products from different categories, including electronics, home appliances, fashion, and more. Customers can create an account to manage their personal information, view their order history, and track their orders.

The website has a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily navigate and find products. They can filter and sort products by category, price range, popularity, and other attributes. Customers can add products to their cart and checkout by entering their shipping and billing information. The website integrates with a payment gateway to securely process online transactions.

The website also includes an administrator panel where site administrators can manage products, orders, customers, and other site settings. Administrators can add, edit, or delete products, view orders and customer information, and update site settings.

The website is built using the ASP.NET Core framework with Entity Framework for database management. Authentication and authorization are implemented using JWT Bearer tokens. The front-end is built using Angular, and the website is designed using the Bootstrap framework for responsive and mobile-friendly layout.

The project includes documentation to help developers understand the architecture and design of the website. The documentation covers the project overview, technical requirements, database schema, API endpoints, and user interfaces. The documentation also includes instructions for setting up the development environment and deploying the website to a production server.

Overall, this project provides a reliable and scalable solution for building an online shopping website with essential features for both customers and site administrators.
